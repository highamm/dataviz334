<p>Leaflet is a useful tool to make interactive maps. It is powered by JavaScript but the <code>R</code> package <code>leaflet</code> lets us take advantage of many of its features. The purpose of this section is to show what kinds of interactive maps we can make with <code>leaflet</code>, but we will not learn all of the details or the customization options of the <code>leaflet</code> package.</p>
<p>The following code is slightly modified from <a href="https://www.linearfragility.com/post/2021-04-09-mapping-breweries-in-us-with-leaflet-in-r/" target="_blank">a blog called Linear Fragility</a>. The goal is to make a map of breweries across the United States that appear in <a href="https://thebeermonthclub.com/" class="uri">https://thebeermonthclub.com/</a>. The data comes <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/brkurzawa/us-breweries" target="_blank">from Kaggle</a> and contains information on 2497 breweries across the United States.</p>
<p>Before we proceed to making the map, we note that, in the blog post, the writer mentions that he uses an <code>R</code> package on his GitHub site.</p>

<p>Not all <code>R</code> packages are submitted to CRAN and are readily installable. But anyone can write their own <code>R</code> package and <strong>not</strong> submit it to CRAN, which is where packages are stored that can be installed with <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/install.packages.html">install.packages()</a></code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>A popular place to store such a package is a GitHub site: <a href="https://github.com/li-wen-li/uszipcodes" class="uri">https://github.com/li-wen-li/uszipcodes</a>. Packages on GitHub are not checked by anyone, so they may or may not actually work, but many are still reliable.</p>
<p>To install a package from GitHub, we can use the <code>devtools</code> package. The <code>name_of_package::name_of_function()</code> is syntax used when we want to denote the package that a particular function comes from. For example, we might use <code><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html">dplyr::filter()</a></code> to let the reader of our code know that the <code><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html">filter()</a></code> function is in the <code>dplyr</code> package.</p>

</div>
<p>Variables include the <code>brewery_name</code>, <code>type</code>, <code>address</code>, and <code>state</code>. But, you’ll notice that the <code>beers</code> data set does not include any spatial coordinates that give the locations of the breweries. There is, however, a variable called <code>address</code>: we will use the <code>uszipcodes</code> package to extract the zip code from the <code>address</code> variable so that we can map a brewery to its zip code.</p>

<p>When you run the code to add the variable <code>Zip</code> to the <code>beers</code> data set, you’ll notice that you’ll get a warning that there are some <code>NA</code> values that were introduced. The functions are not perfect: there are some zip codes that were not properly extracted from the address.</p>
<p>Finally, we join the zip codes, along with their latitudes and longitudes, to the <code>beers</code> data:</p>

<p>The next part of the code makes the <code>content</code> data set, which adds a variable called <code>popup</code> that contains the brewery website and name. This variable eventually contains the values the “pop up” on the map when we hover over a data point.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise 2a</strong>. Run <code>leaflet(beer_location) |&gt; setView(lng = -98.583, lat = 39.833, zoom = 4)</code> and explain what the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/leaflet/man/map-methods.html">setView()</a></code> function does.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2b</strong>. Run <code>leaflet(beer_location) |&gt; setView(lng = -98.583, lat = 39.833, zoom = 4) |&gt; addTiles()</code> and explain what the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/leaflet/man/map-layers.html">addTiles()</a></code> function does.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2c</strong>.

You may also want to check out the help <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/leaflet/man/addProviderTiles.html">?addProviderTiles</a></code>.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2d</strong>. Run <code>leaflet(beer_location) |&gt; setView(lng = -98.583, lat = 39.833, zoom = 4) |&gt; addTiles() |&gt; addProviderTiles(providers$Wikimedia) |&gt; addMarkers(lng = beer_location$Longitude, lat = beer_location$Latitude)</code> and explain what the <code>addMarkders()</code> function does.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2e</strong>. Run the code in Exercise 2d, but add <code>clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions()</code> as an argument to <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/leaflet/man/map-layers.html">addMarkers()</a></code>. Explain what adding this argument does to the map.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2f</strong>. Finally, run the code in Exercise 2e but add <code>popup = content$popup</code> as an argument to <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/leaflet/man/map-layers.html">addMarkers()</a></code>. Explain what adding this argument does to the map.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3</strong>. Examine <a href="http://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/" target="_blank">this link&gt;</a> to look at various “provider” tiles (in the scroll bar on the right-hand side of the page). Choose one to change from Wikimedia and explain how the resulting map looks different.</p>

<p>The <code>plotly</code> <code>R</code> package lets us modify a static (non-interactive) graph to become interactive. This is useful if we <strong>don’t</strong> have any one particular point that we want to highlight or label but we <strong>do</strong> want to allow the user to explore data that cannot be easily communicated on the plot. Like <code>leaflet</code>, <code>plotly</code> can be used in other software (Python, Julia, etc.) and can be used to make almost any plot interactive in this way.</p>
<p>To use <code>plotly</code>, we need to first install the package and load it (along with <code>tidyverse</code>) into our current <code>R</code> session:</p>

<p>If we were interested in labeling <strong>1</strong> particular country, then we can do so with <code><a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_text.html">geom_label()</a></code> or <code>geom_label_repel()</code>. But, if we want the user to be able to hover over any point in the scatterplot to see the name of the country, we can use <code>plotly</code>.</p>
<p>First, we assign out plot a name so that we can reference it with a plotly function. In this example, we name our plot <code>plot1</code>.</p>

<p>Simple! However, by default, plotly labels the points with their x and y values, not by another variable in the data set. We need to add a <code>label</code> <code><a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/aes.html">aes()</a></code> to our plot and then use the <code>tooltip</code> argument in <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/plotly/man/ggplotly.html">ggplotly()</a></code> to specify that points should be labeled by what we specified in the <code>label</code> aesthetic.</p>

<p>Your plot should now be interactive and label the points by their country: sick! The syntax for <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/plotly/man/ggplotly.html">ggplotly()</a></code> might seem kind of odd now, but, because it’s consistent for all types of plots (specifying a label aesthetic and then using <code>tooltip = "label"</code>), it’s actually a pretty simple package to use!</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong>. Use the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/plotly/man/ggplotly.html">ggplotly()</a></code> function on any bar plot that we’ve made so far in the course.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong>. Use the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/plotly/man/ggplotly.html">ggplotly()</a></code> function on any side-by-side box plots that we’ve made so far in the course.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3</strong>. Use the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/plotly/man/ggplotly.html">ggplotly()</a></code> function on any faceted plot that we’ve made so far in the course.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 4</strong>. Use the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/plotly/man/ggplotly.html">ggplotly()</a></code> function on any plot of your choice that we’ve made so far in the course. For this exercise, really try to think about a plot that would benefit from becoming interactive.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 5</strong>. You can also remove hover info for particular items with the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/plotly/man/style.html">style()</a></code> function. In particular, specifying <code>hoverinfo == "none"</code> for particular <code>traces</code> removes the hover info for those <code>traces</code>. Modify one of the following examples so that hover info is <strong>only</strong> displayed for the points (and not for the smoother or the standard error bar for the smoother).</p>
