Uncertainy quiz

**Example 3**.

Next, consider a data set on National Football League teams, called `standings.csv` This data set contains the number of wins and losses for **each** team in very season from 2000 through 2019. In STAT/DATA 234, we made a graph that showed each team's overall win percentage during this time period.

```{r, appendix = TRUE}
nfl_df <- read_csv("data/standings.csv")
nfl_sum <- nfl_df %>% group_by(team) %>%
  summarise(nwins = sum(wins),
            nlosses = sum(loss)) %>%
  mutate(ngames = nwins + nlosses,
         win_percentage = 100 * nwins / ngames) %>%
  mutate(team = fct_reorder(team, win_percentage))
ggplot(data = nfl_sum, aes(x = team, y = win_percentage)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_segment(aes(x = team, xend = team, y = 0, yend = win_percentage)) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(y = "Win Percentage")
```

Modify the chart so that it shows the **variability** in each team's win percentage from season to season. We will work through part of this as a class.
